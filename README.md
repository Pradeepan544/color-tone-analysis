# color-tone-analysis
Color Tone Analysis is a deep learning project designed to predict human skin tones into three categories: Warm, Cool, and Neutral. By leveraging a sequential CNN model, this tool provides a robust and accurate way to analyze face tones from user-uploaded images.

## Dataset
- Combined multiple publicly available datasets focusing on diverse skin tones.
- Preprocessed and labeled the data into three categories: Warm, Cool, and Neutral.
- Data augmentation techniques were applied to ensure the model's robustness.

## Features  
- Combined multiple datasets for enhanced diversity and accuracy.  
- Labels skin tones into three categories: **Warm**, **Cool**, and **Neutral**.  
- Trained a sequential CNN model with 99% accuracy.  
- Accepts user-uploaded images and determines face tones.

## Model
- Architecture: Sequential Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- Framework: TensorFlow/Keras.
- Training Accuracy: 99%.
- Optimization Techniques:
- Data Augmentation
- Adam Optimizer
